* SharedComponents

An entity with a SharedComponent<T> doesn't own a component of type T themselves, but links to that owned by another entity. Using the entity manager's getSharedComponentOr a reference to the corresponding T can be retrieved, regardless of whether the entity has a T or a SharedComponent<T>.

The entity referenced by the SharedComponent<T> will be identified via its Tag component and via its ID; when the shared component is first accessed, the entity with the specified TagComponent will be searched and the entity ID variable in the shared component will be set accordingly.

The entity that owns the actual T will have a LinkedEntitiesComponent, in which the entities that reference this entity will be linked. The addComponent overload for SharedComponent<T>s will assure this component is attached to the reference entity and if necessary attach it. Furthermore, it'll add the referencing entity to the LinkedEntitiesComponent of the reference entity.

The LinkedEntitiesComponent will be initialized at runtime and will not be saved.
